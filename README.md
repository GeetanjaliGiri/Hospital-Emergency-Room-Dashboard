# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Dashboard
 In this Project an Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard is created in MS Excel to improve efficiency and provide useful insights. This dashboard will help stakeholders monitor, analyze, and make better decisions for managing patients and improving services.
 
  Key Insights Covered in the Dashboard:
✅ Total Number of Patients
✅ Average Wait Time to See a Patient
✅ Patient Admission Status (Admitted/Not Admitted)
✅ Patient Age Distribution
✅ Gender Analysis
✅ Department Referrals
✅ Percentage of Patients Seen Within 30 Minutes

In this project I have used Power query to Extract and Transform data, Power Pivot to Create relationship and Add DAX Formula then Pivot Tables to generate reports, AND Data Visualization techniques to create an interactive dashboard that helps hospitals optimize emergency room operations.
